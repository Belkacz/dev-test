  <h4>Developer test</h4>
  <div class="mt-3">
    We have created a series of tasks that will test your ability to work with both the frontend and backend of a web application. Each task becomes
    progressively slightly more complex.<br /><br />

    Each page will present a task that needs to be solved. Some tasks will require your expertise in Vue.js for the frontend, while others will demand your
    knowledge of Javascript and Express.js for backend development.<br /><br />

    On every page, you will find a description of the task. Your mission is to apply your problem-solving skills and make the necessary changes to successfully
    complete the tasks.<br /><br />

    Solve as many task as you like. You are allowed to use google but please don't use chatGPT to solve an entire task.
